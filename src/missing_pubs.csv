In these papers, evidence for association is mostly observed in multiplex families with Alzheimer's disease, whereas case–control samples of sporadic Alzheimer's disease are predominantly negative. Methods: After sequencing VR22 in multiplex families with  ...||L Bertram, K Mullin, M Parkinson, M Hsiao… - Journal of medical  …

Among the putative candidate genes in this area are the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNA7) and its partial duplication, CHRFAM7A. A large chromosomal segment including the CHRFAM7A gene locus, but not the CHRNA7 locus, is deleted in some individuals. The CHRFAM7A gene  ...||ML Sinkus, MJ Lee, J Gault, J Logel, M Short… - Brain research

Here, we present evidence for genetic association of ADAM10 with Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as two rare potentially disease-associated non-synonymous mutations, Q170H and R181G, in the ADAM10 prodomain. These mutations were found in 11 of 16 affected individuals ( ...||M Kim, J Suh, D Romano, MH Truong… - Human molecular  …

However, a variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes, in different parts of the gene, have been reported to be associated in different samples, and a precise molecular mechanism of disease remains to be defined.

Genetic variation in MOR and MOR interacting proteins (MORIPs) involved in MOR signaling may increase risk for drug dependence. The MORIP, B-arrestin, plays an important role in the regulation of MOR trafficking thereby highlighting it as a candidate gene for addiction phenotypes.
