The aim of this study was therefore to investigate side effects related to major psychotropic drugs in two independent samples of BD patients naturalistically treated with mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics and/or anxiolytics. Overall, 3654 patients from the  ...||A Serretti, A Chiesa, R Calati, C Fabbri… - Journal of

We here developed novel methods to examine in animal models and humans whether extreme amount of minor alleles (MAs) carried by an individual may represent extreme trait values and common diseases.
