Genetic variants of Nogo-66 receptor with possible association to schizophrenia block myelin inhibition of axon growth||http://www.jneurosci.org/content/28/49/13161.short||2008||78||14||4741873179683623060||None||http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=4741873179683623060&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en||http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=4741873179683623060&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5||None||Abstract In schizophrenia, genetic predisposition has been linked to chromosome 22q11 and myelin-specific genes are misexpressed in schizophrenia. Nogo-66 receptor 1 (NGR or RTN4R) has been considered to be a 22q11 candidate gene for schizophrenia susceptibility because it encodes an axonal protein that mediates myelin inhibition of axonal sprouting. Confirming previous studies, we found that variation at the NGR locus is associated with  ...||S Budel, T Padukkavidana, BP Liu, Z Feng… - Journal of  …

Dopaminergic brain systems have been implicated to play a major role in drug reward (Hyman et al., 2006), thus making genes involved in these circuits plausible  ...||PJ Bloch, AH Nall, AE Weller, TN Ferraro… - Psychiatric  …
