Studies in three independent cohorts have shown that psychosis in AD aggregates in families, with estimated heritability of 29.5–60.8%.

832||Combined Analysis from Eleven Linkage Studies of Bipolar Disorder Provides Strong Evidence of Susceptibility Loci on Chromosomes 6q and 8q||http://ir.kmu.edu.tw/handle/310902000/17183||2005||0||2||None||None||None||http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=11620981646216828800&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5||None||Several independent studies and meta-analyses aimed at identifying genomic regions linked to bipolar disorder (BP) have failed to find clear and consistent evidence of linkage regions. Our hypothesis is that combining the original genotype data provides benefits of increased power and control over sources of heterogeneity that outweigh the difficulty and potential pitfalls of the implementation. We conducted a combined analysis using the  ...||卓夙航 -

The altered expression at the LCL level would be useful for developing diagnostic markers as well as a cellular model for bipolar disorder. In this study, we extended our previous study by measuring their expressions using the following samples:( ...||K Iwamoto, M Bundo, S Washizuka, C Kakiuchi… - Journal of human  …839||Expression of HSPF1 and LIM in the lymphoblastoid cells derived from patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia||http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10038-004-0136-5||2004||57||14||9293775638023505012||None||http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=9293775638023505012&as_sdt=2005&sciodt=0,5&hl=en||http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=9293775638023505012&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5||None||Abstract We have previously reported the altered expressions of HSPF1 and LIM in the lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from Japanese patients with bipolar disorder (bipolar I disorder).

Prior studies have identified clinical features that differ between these two diseases but have been limited by heterogeneity and lack of replication. We sought to identify depression-related features that distinguish BP from MDD in large samples with replication.
